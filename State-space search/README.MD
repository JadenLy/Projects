# State-space search

This project is implemented using Python. 

The project is to apply the search algorithm to the game of Eight Puzzle. The game includes plain search and search with heuristics. 

The original description for this project can be found [here](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse415/17au/assign/A3.html). Credits go to the instructor, Steve Tanimoto. 

The implementation includes A-star Search and Breadth-first Search, as well as the four heuristic used for the game.
