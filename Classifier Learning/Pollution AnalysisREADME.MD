# Pollution Analysis

This project uses Python.

The project is to apply multiple machine learning models on the data representing air pollutions. 

The pdf file named "Stat 391 Mini Project" gives a preliminary report on how I perform each analysis. 

Machine Learning models used: PCA, K-Means Clustering, Hierarchical Clustering, Least-square, Ridge and Lasso Regression, LDA, QDA and SVM as Classification method.
