# Game-Playing Agents

This project is based on Python.

The project is to explore a two-player and zero-sum game, timed k-in-a-row. The table setting for the game can be modified with blocks and sizing. 

The original description for this project can be found [here](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse415/17au/assign/A5.html) in part II. Credits go to the instructor, Steve Tanimoto. 

The implementation mainly includes the minimax algorithm with some evaluation heuristics developed uniquely.
