# Dynamic Programming

This implementation uses JAVA.

This project is to find an optimal lineup with 9 players in 6 positions using the given data. Use build.xml file to compile and run the project.

The original description for this project can be found [here](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse417/18wi/hws/hw6/hw6.html)

The implementation mainly involves using dynamic programming recursively to find the lineup. In addition, the code also includes an implementation to find the best linup without any correlation, i.e. no two players from the same team whose positions are QB and WR, QB and K, or K and DEF.
