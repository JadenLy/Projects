# Coordinate Descent

This project is to fit a model for all NFL teams in both offensive and defensive aspect so that it best fits the given collection of data. It generate a linear model with 65 parameters. The loss function applies a regularization with L1-norm. Use build.xml file to compile and run the project. 

Original description for this project can be found [here](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse417/18wi/hws/hw2/hw2.html)


The implementation is mainly the coordinate descent algorithm with given ternery search method. An extra implementation is to find a sparse model with a specific number of non-zero parameters.
